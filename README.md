# Cryptocurrency Exchanges

The easiest way to buy crypto is to get into an exchange.

Note that when you buy crypto, you should really be the holder of it, and not have a 3rd
party hold it.

For example, RobinHood lets you "buy" crypto, like Bitcoin, but you can not transfer it out of
RobinHood to another exchange so you really do not own it. Avoid this. The real exchanges are
just as easy to use as RobinHood, and you will want to be able to transfer your money to a wallet
or another exchange.

* Coinbase - the biggest exchange

* Kraken - lots of staking opportunities

* Gemini

* Binance - Has its own blockchain and coin. Lots of coins that can not be bought in many other exchanges.
